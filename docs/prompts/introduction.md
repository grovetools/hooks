# Documentation Generation Task: Introduction

You are an expert technical writer creating documentation for `grove-hooks`. Based on the `README.md` and the overall codebase, write a clear, engaging introduction that:
- Explains that `grove-hooks` is a local-first observability and state management tool for the Grove ecosystem.
- Highlights its key features: local SQLite storage, automatic session tracking for Claude Code, `grove-flow` job monitoring, and an interactive TUI.
- Describes the problem it solves: providing developers with a unified, local, and offline-capable view of all AI agent activity.
- Identifies the target audience: Developers using the Grove ecosystem (Claude Code, `grove-flow`).
